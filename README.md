# Sorting Visualizer (Java - Console Version)

A beginner-friendly Java project that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work step by step.  
This program takes user input, applies sorting algorithms, and prints the intermediate array states after each iteration,  
helping to build strong fundamentals in sorting and debugging.

## âœ¨ Features
- Input custom array size and elements
- Choose sorting algorithm: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort
- See step-by-step progress of sorting
- Displays total swaps and comparisons for performance understanding
- Final sorted output

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on practice with arrays, loops, and methods in Java
- Deep understanding of sorting algorithm mechanics
- Debugging skills by tracing intermediate steps

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Add Merge Sort & Quick Sort
- Compare algorithm performance
- GUI-based visualization with bars/animations
